Space Explorer Welcome !

Far and Away is set in a distant future (or maby not so distant ... ) where humanity has reached the limits of it's own world, Earth. The resources are scarce and time is running short. You have been chosen, and with you, your decendants, due to your exceptional abilities to command a Space Fleet and your knowledge of Space exploration.

At the start of the game you will be about to leave your home world for the far reaches of Space. As you will exlopre new worlds humanity will follow in your path exploiting the worlds you have explored to provide you with some knowledge and ressources to continue your journey, and that of humanity. Beware, though, with time the resources and knowledge provided by the worlds you have explore will become insignificant yet you will still have to sustain your fleet. Hence, if you want to survive, and with you humanity, you have to manage your knowledge and resource, wait for peaks in production to explore, know when to spend extra knowledge to aquier resources ... or the opposite.

--Aim of the Game--
Explore as many planets as possible before running out of resource points !!

-- How to play --
left-click : Moves the player's location to that planet (planet highlighted in green)
right-click : searches around the planet for other planets
space bar: pauses the game time

First of all: every 10 seconds a year will pass... you will get all your yearly point incomes (KP = knowledge points, RP = resource points) minus all your costs. Each year you also have a small chance of discovering new planets.

If you hoover the mouse over a planet you will see some details on it. the KP and RP values displayed are the amount of points you will get for exploring this planet (minus the exploration costs ... set to 10 RP at the moment). Once explored the values displayed in brackets (+X/month) indicates how much points will be added to your total each month . You will notice that this value will decay with time, this is normal and it represents Humanity depleting the resources of the planet... or if you'd rather Humanity taking on the resources for itself to survive and leaving you less points.

Left-click on a planet to go to it. The cost in resources to go from one planet to another is given by steps^2 ... a step being a unit segment of the grid. So yes, jupping to the nearby planet and then the next etc... all the way to the other end of your empire is the way to do it to only spend 1 point per move. So if a planet is X segments away and you have discovered and explored all the planets in between you are better of going to each planet in turn (costing you a total of X) rather than jumping strait to the destination which will cost you X^2.

When you hoover the mouse over an explored planet you can also search for nearby planets. To do so just right-mouse button click the planet you want to search around (you do not have to be located on the planet to search around it as long as it has been explored). The search cost is variable and unpredictable so be careful (generally speaking the greater the cost the more likely there is to be planets nearby).

--Developer's Notes--

The game is still in it's beginnings so the "decay rules" of KP (knowledge points) and RP (resource points) are not yet calibrated ... so the game is currently too easy or just impossible to finish.
